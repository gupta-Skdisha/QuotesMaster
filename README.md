# 🌟 Random Quote Generator

This project is a **simple and stylish Random Quote Generator** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It displays a random inspirational quote along with its author's name when a button is clicked.

> ⚠️ Note: This project is inspired by [eman289's Random Quote App](eman289.). I’ve made my own enhancements including visual theme updates, dark mode, new quotes, and structural changes.

## 💡 Code Explanation

The core logic is written in vanilla JavaScript. Here's a quick overview:

- `quotes[]` – An array containing quote objects with `text` and `author` properties.
- `newQuote()` – Picks a random quote, avoiding repeating the last one.
- `previousIndex` – Remembers the last quote to prevent duplication.
- DOM manipulation using `getElementById()` updates the quote and author.
